To loose emails


I would recommend avoiding email clients like Microsoft Outlook, Apple Mail and even my beloved [Mozilla Thunderbird][thunderbird] for something with a web interface. Just about all hosting providers have a webmail interface available. Problem is, most of the free webmail interfaces like [Horde][horde], [Round Cube][roundcude]and [Squirrel Mail][squirrelmail] might be lacking in the user experience department. 

Most people have grown up with an email client like Microsoft Outlook and more recently Apple Mail and will make use of their hosting providers incoming mail server POP3 and their internet providers outgoing mail server SMTP. In most cases, when your email client downloads email from the mail server to your computer, the email on the mail server will be deleted. It's easy to configure your email client to rather leave the email on the server, in which case you will ultimately run out of email server disk space, meaning incoming email will start bouncing, or you'll start paying for disk overages. 

If you're like most people, knowingly or ignorantly, you'll go for the first option. Using the email client that's preinstalled on your computer, that will download email to your computer and deletes it from the email server. 

There are a few potential problems with this choice. If you're on a Windows PC you're going to need good anti-virus software.
Now you need to buy a good virus scanner and if, for some reason your hard drive crashes or your notebook is stolen, all your email is gone. Even if, nothing ever goes wrong, when you buy a new pc, you'll be spending hours migrating all your old email to your new pc. This sounds like a lot of uneccesary effort and responsibility to me. In my opinion, you should be focusing on your core business. 

These are just some of the reasons why I
I highly recommend signing up with a reputable online cloud email provider. There are numerous options to choose from. At time of writing I'd recommend Google Apps, Office 365 or even Rackspace Mail.
