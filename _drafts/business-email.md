If you have a choice, I would recommend ditching email clients like Microsoft Outlook, Apple Mail and even my beloved Mozilla Thunderbird for something with a web interface. Just about all hosting providers have a webmail interface available. Problem is, a lot of the webmail interfaces provided are installs of old open source software that's seriously lacking in the user experience department. 

Most people have grown up with an email client like Microsoft Outlook and more recently Apple Mail and will make use of their hosting providers incoming mail server POP and their internet providers outgoing mail server SMTP. In most cases, when your email client download email from a server to your computer, the email on the server will be deleted. Alternatively you can configure you email client to leave the email on the server, in which case you will ultimately run out of disk space or start paying for overages. 

If you're like most people, knowing or ignorantly, you'll go for the first option that downloads the email to your computer and deletes it from the email server. 

Now you need to buy a good virus scanner and if, for some reason your hard drive crashes or your notebook is stolen, all your email is gone. Even if you're lucky and you buy a brand new pc, you'll now have to migrate all your email to your new pc. This sounds like a lot of uneccesary effort and responsibility to me. 

In my opinion, you should be focusing on your core business. 

I highly recommend signing up with a reputable online cloud email provider. There are numerous options to choose from. At time of writing I'd recommend Google Apps, Office 365 or even Rackspace Mail.
